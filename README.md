* *Kronecker Product* is utilized to construct the sparse matrix efficiently and regularly.
* Discrete optimization is solved with the *Straight-Through Estimator* trick.
* Automatically learn the number of groups in an end-to-end differentiable fashion.

## ResNeXt-50 on ImageNet

**DGConv** is used as a drop-in replacement of depthwise separable convolution in the original ResNeXt to build G-ResNeXt-50/101 network architectures. Here are some results of their performance comparison.

| Architecture                                                 | LR decay strategy   | Top-1 / Top-5 Accuracy |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| [ResNeXt-50 (32x4d)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zVQm-aoJV6GRi-mCds7B8HVcsI8Jbjim) | cosine (120 epochs) | 78.198 / 93.916        |
| [G-ResNeXt](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1elM-FVacE-Pkin_hCiW24oKCogHEaYRn) | cosine (120 epochs) | 78.592 / 94.106        |
